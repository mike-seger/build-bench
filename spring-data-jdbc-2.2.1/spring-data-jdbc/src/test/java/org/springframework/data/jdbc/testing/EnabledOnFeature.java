/**
 * {@code @RequiredFeature} is used to signal that the annotated test class or test method is only <em>enabled</em> on
 * one or more specified Spring Data JDBC {@link org.springframework.data.jdbc.testing.TestDatabaseFeatures.Feature
 * features} are supported by the underlying database.
 * <p>
 * When applied at the class level, all test methods within that class will be enabled if they support all database
 * features.
 * <p>
 * If a test method is disabled via this annotation, that does not prevent the test class from being instantiated.
 * Rather, it prevents the execution of the test method and method-level lifecycle callbacks such as {@code @BeforeEach}
 * methods, {@code @AfterEach} methods, and corresponding extension APIs. When annotated on method and class level, all
 * annotated features must match to run a test.
 * <p>
 * This annotation cannot be used as meta-annotation.
