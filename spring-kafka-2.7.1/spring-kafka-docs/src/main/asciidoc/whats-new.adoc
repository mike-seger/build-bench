=== What's New in 2.7 Since 2.6

This section covers the changes made from version 2.6 to version 2.7.
For changes in earlier version, see <<history>>.

[[x27-kafka-client]]
==== Kafka Client Version

This version requires the 2.7.0 `kafka-clients`.
It is also compatible with the 2.8.0 clients, since version 2.7.1; see <<update-deps>>.

[[x-27-nonblock-retry]]
==== Non-Blocking Delayed Retries Using Topics

This significant new feature is added in this release.
When strict ordering is not important, failed deliveries can be sent to another topic to be consumed later.
A series of such retry topics can be configured, with increasing delays.
See <<retry-topic>> for more information.

[[x27-container]]
==== Listener Container Changes

The `onlyLogRecordMetadata` container property is now `true` by default.

A new container property `stopImmediate` is now available.

See <<container-props>> for more information.

Error handlers that use a `BackOff` between delivery attempts (e.g. `SeekToCurrentErrorHandler` and `DefaultAfterRollbackProcessor`) will now exit the back off interval soon after the container is stopped, rather than delaying the stop.
See <<after-rollback>> and <<seek-to-current>> for more information.

Error handlers and after rollback processors that extend `FailedRecordProcessor` can now be configured with one or more `RetryListener` s to receive information about retry and recovery progress.

See See <<after-rollback>>, <<seek-to-current>>, and <<recovering-batch-eh>> for more information.

The `RecordInterceptor` now has additional methods called after the listener returns (normally, or by throwing an exception).
It also has a sub-interface `ConsumerAwareRecordInterceptor`.
In addition, there is now a `BatchInterceptor` for batch listeners.
See <<message-listener-container>> for more information.

[[x27-listener]]
==== `@KafkaListener` Changes

You can now validate the payload parameter of `@KafkaHandler` methods (class-level listeners).
See <<kafka-validation>> for more information.

You can now set the `rawRecordHeader` property on the `MessagingMessageConverter` and `BatchMessagingMessageConverter` which causes the raw `ConsumerRecord` to be added to the converted `Message<?>`.
This is useful, for example, if you wish to use a `DeadLetterPublishingRecoverer` in a listener error handler.
See <<listener-error-handlers>> for more information.

[[x27-dlt]]
==== `DeadLetterPublishingRecover` Changes

Now, if both the key and value fail deserialization, the original values are published to the DLT.
Previously, the value was populated but the key `DeserializationException` remained in the headers.
There is a breaking API change, if you subclassed the recoverer and overrode the `createProducerRecord` method.

In addition, the recoverer verifies that the partition selected by the destination resolver actually exists before publishing to it.

See <<dead-letters>> for more information.

[[x27-CKTM]]
==== `ChainedKafkaTransactionManager` is Deprecated

See <<transactions>> for more information.

[[x27-RKT]]
==== `ReplyingKafkaTemplate` Changes

There is now a mechanism to examine a reply and fail the future exceptionally if some condition exists.

Support for sending and receiving `spring-messaging` `Message<?>` s has been added.

See <<replying-template>> for more information.

[[x27-streams]]
==== Kafka Streams Changes

By default, the `StreamsBuilderFactoryBean` is now configured to not clean up local state.
See <<streams-config>> for more information.

[[x27-admin]]
==== `KafkaAdmin` Changes

New methods `createOrModifyTopics` and `describeTopics` have been added.
`KafkaAdmin.NewTopics` has been added to facilitate configuring multiple topics in a single bean.
See <<configuring-topics>> for more information.

[[x27-conv]]
==== `MessageConverter` Changes

It is now possible to add a `spring-messaging` `SmartMessageConverter` to the `MessagingMessageConverter`, allowing content negotiation based on the `contentType` header.
See <<messaging-message-conversion>> for more information.
