=== Changes between 2.5 and 2.6

[[x26-kafka-client]]
==== Kafka Client Version

This version requires the 2.6.0 `kafka-clients`.

==== Listener Container Changes

The default `EOSMode` is now `BETA`.
See <<exactly-once>> for more information.

Various error handlers (that extend `FailedRecordProcessor`) and the `DefaultAfterRollbackProcessor` now reset the `BackOff` if recovery fails.
In addition, you can now select the `BackOff` to use based on the failed record and/or exception.
See <<seek-to-current>>, <<recovering-batch-eh>>, <<dead-letters>> and <<after-rollback>> for more information.

You can now configure an `adviceChain` in the container properties.
See <<container-props>> for more information.

When the container is configured to publish `ListenerContainerIdleEvent` s, it now publishes a `ListenerContainerNoLongerIdleEvent` when a record is received after publishing an idle event.
See <<events>> and <<idle-containers>> for more information.

==== @KafkaListener Changes

When using manual partition assignment, you can now specify a wildcard for determining which partitions should be reset to the initial offset.
In addition, if the listener implements `ConsumerSeekAware`, `onPartitionsAssigned()` is called after the manual assignment.
(Also added in version 2.5.5).
See <<manual-assignment>> for more information.

Convenience methods have been added to `AbstractConsumerSeekAware` to make seeking easier.
See <<seek>> for more information.

==== ErrorHandler Changes

Subclasses of `FailedRecordProcessor` (e.g. `SeekToCurrentErrorHandler`, `DefaultAfterRollbackProcessor`, `RecoveringBatchErrorHandler`) can now be configured to reset the retry state if the exception is a different type to that which occurred previously with this record.
See <<seek-to-current>>, <<after-rollback>>, <<recovering-batch-eh>> for more information.

==== Producer Factory Changes

You can now set a maximum age for producers after which they will be closed and recreated.
See <<transactions>> for more information.

You can now update the configuration map after the `DefaultKafkaProducerFactory` has been created.
This might be useful, for example, if you have to update SSL key/trust store locations after a credentials change.
See <<producer-factory>> for more information.

=== Changes between 2.4 and 2.5

This section covers the changes made from version 2.4 to version 2.5.
For changes in earlier version, see <<history>>.

[[x25-factory-listeners]]
==== Consumer/Producer Factory Changes

The default consumer and producer factories can now invoke a callback whenever a consumer or producer is created or closed.
Implementations for native Micrometer metrics are provided.
See <<factory-listeners>> for more information.

You can now change bootstrap server properties at runtime, enabling failover to another Kafka cluster.
See <<connecting>> for more information.

[[x25-streams-listeners]]
==== `StreamsBuilderFactoryBean` Changes

The factory bean can now invoke a callback whenever a `KafkaStreams` created or destroyed.
An Implementation for native Micrometer metrics is provided.
See <<streams-micrometer>> for more information.

[[x25-kafka-client]]
==== Kafka Client Version

This version requires the 2.5.0 `kafka-clients`.

==== Class/Package Changes

`SeekUtils` has been moved from the `o.s.k.support` package to `o.s.k.listener`.

[[x25-delivery]]
==== Delivery Attempts Header

There is now an option to to add a header which tracks delivery attempts when using certain error handlers and after rollback processors.
See <<delivery-header>> for more information.

[[x25-message-return]]
==== @KafkaListener Changes

Default reply headers will now be populated automatically if needed when a `@KafkaListener` return type is `Message<?>`.
See <<reply-message>> for more information.

The `KafkaHeaders.RECEIVED_MESSAGE_KEY` is no longer populated with a `null` value when the incoming record has a `null` key; the header is omitted altogether.

`@KafkaListener` methods can now specify a `ConsumerRecordMetadata` parameter instead of using discrete headers for metadata such as topic, partition, etc.
See <<consumer-record-metadata>> for more information.

[[x25-container]]
==== Listener Container Changes

The `assignmentCommitOption` container property is now `LATEST_ONLY_NO_TX` by default.
See <<container-props>> for more information.

The `subBatchPerPartition` container property is now `true` by default when using transactions.
See <<transactions>> for more information.

A new `RecoveringBatchErrorHandler` is now provided.
See <<recovering-batch-eh>> for more information.

Static group membership is now supported.
See <<message-listener-container>> for more information.

When incremental/cooperative rebalancing is configured, if offsets fail to commit with a non-fatal `RebalanceInProgressException`, the container will attempt to re-commit the offsets for the partitions that remain assigned to this instance after the rebalance is completed.

The default error handler is now the `SeekToCurrentErrorHandler` for record listeners and `RecoveringBatchErrorHandler` for batch listeners.
See <<error-handlers>> for more information.

You can now control the level at which exceptions intentionally thrown by standard error handlers are logged.
See <<error-handlers>> for more information.

The `getAssignmentsByClientId()` method has been added, making it easier to determine which consumers in a concurrent container are assigned which partition(s).
See <<container-props>> for more information.

You can now suppress logging entire `ConsumerRecord` s in error, debug logs etc.
See `onlyLogRecordMetadata` in <<container-props>>.

[[x25-template]]
==== KafkaTemplate Changes

The `KafkaTemplate` can now maintain micrometer timers.
See <<micrometer>> for more information.

The `KafkaTemplate` can now be configured with `ProducerConfig` properties to override those in the producer factory.
See <<kafka-template>> for more information.

A `RoutingKafkaTemplate` has now been provided.
See <<routing-template>> for more information.

You can now use `KafkaSendCallback` instead of `ListenerFutureCallback` to get a narrower exception, making it easier to extract the failed `ProducerRecord`.
See <<kafka-template>> for more information.

[[x25-string-serializer]]
==== Kafka String Serializer/Deserializer

New `ToStringSerializer`/`StringDeserializer` s as well as an associated `SerDe` are now provided.
See <<string-serde>> for more information.

[[x25-json-deser]]
==== JsonDeserializer

The `JsonDeserializer` now has more flexibility to determine the deserialization type.
See <<serdes-type-methods>> for more information.

[[x25-delegate-serde]]
==== Delegating Serializer/Deserializer

The `DelegatingSerializer` can now handle "standard" types, when the outbound record has no header.
See <<delegating-serialization>> for more information.

[[x25-testing]]
==== Testing Changes

The `KafkaTestUtils.consumerProps()` helper record now sets `ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG` to `earliest` by default.
See <<junit>> for more information.

=== Changes between 2.3 and 2.4

[[kafka-client-2.4]]
==== Kafka Client Version

This version requires the 2.4.0 `kafka-clients` or higher and supports the new incremental rebalancing feature.

[[x24-carl]]
==== ConsumerAwareRebalanceListener

Like `ConsumerRebalanceListener`, this interface now has an additional method `onPartitionsLost`.
Refer to the Apache Kafka documentation for more information.

Unlike the `ConsumerRebalanceListener`, The default implementation does **not** call `onPartitionsRevoked`.
Instead, the listener container will call that method after it has called `onPartitionsLost`; you should not, therefore, do the same when implementing `ConsumerAwareRebalanceListener`.

See the IMPORTANT note at the end of <<rebalance-listeners>> for more information.

[[x24-eh]]
==== GenericErrorHandler

The `isAckAfterHandle()` default implementation now returns true by default.

[[x24-template]]
==== KafkaTemplate

The `KafkaTemplate` now supports non-transactional publishing alongside transactional.
See <<tx-template-mixed>> for more information.

[[x24-agg]]
==== AggregatingReplyingKafkaTemplate

The `releaseStrategy` is now a `BiConsumer`.
It is now called after a timeout (as well as when records arrive); the second parameter is `true` in the case of a call after a timeout.

See <<aggregating-request-reply>> for more information.

==== Listener Container

The `ContainerProperties` provides an `authorizationExceptionRetryInterval` option to let the listener container to retry after any `AuthorizationException` is thrown by the `KafkaConsumer`.
See its JavaDocs and <<kafka-container>> for more information.

==== @KafkaListener

The `@KafkaListener` annotation has a new property `splitIterables`; default true.
When a replying listener returns an `Iterable` this property controls whether the return result is sent as a single record or a record for each element is sent.
See <<annotation-send-to>> for more information

Batch listeners can now be configured with a `BatchToRecordAdapter`; this allows, for example, the batch to be processed in a transaction while the listener gets one record at a time.
With the default implementation, a `ConsumerRecordRecoverer` can be used to handle errors within the batch, without stopping the processing of the entire batch - this might be useful when using transactions.
See <<transactions-batch>> for more information.

==== Kafka Streams

The `StreamsBuilderFactoryBean` accepts a new property `KafkaStreamsInfrastructureCustomizer`.
This allows configuration of the builder and/or topology before the stream is created.
See <<streams-spring>> for more information.

=== Changes Between 2.2 and 2.3

This section covers the changes made from version 2.2 to version 2.3.

==== Tips, Tricks and Examples

A new chapter <<tips-n-tricks>> has been added.
Please submit GitHub issues and/or pull requests for additional entries in that chapter.

[[kafka-client-2.2]]
==== Kafka Client Version

This version requires the 2.3.0 `kafka-clients` or higher.

==== Class/Package Changes

`TopicPartitionInitialOffset` is deprecated in favor of `TopicPartitionOffset`.

==== Configuration Changes

Starting with version 2.3.4, the `missingTopicsFatal` container property is false by default.
When this is true, the application fails to start if the broker is down; many users were affected by this change; given that Kafka is a high-availability platform, we did not anticipate that starting an application with no active brokers would be a common use case.

==== Producer and Consumer Factory Changes

The `DefaultKafkaProducerFactory` can now be configured to create a producer per thread.
You can also provide `Supplier<Serializer>` instances in the constructor as an alternative to either configured classes (which require no-arg constructors), or constructing with `Serializer` instances, which are then shared between all Producers.
See <<producer-factory>> for more information.

The same option is available with `Supplier<Deserializer>` instances in `DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory`.
See <<kafka-container>> for more information.

==== Listener Container Changes

Previously, error handlers received `ListenerExecutionFailedException` (with the actual listener exception as the `cause`) when the listener was invoked using a listener adapter (such as `@KafkaListener` s).
Exceptions thrown by native `GenericMessageListener` s were passed to the error handler unchanged.
Now a `ListenerExecutionFailedException` is always the argument (with the actual listener exception as the `cause`), which provides access to the container's `group.id` property.

Because the listener container has it's own mechanism for committing offsets, it prefers the Kafka `ConsumerConfig.ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT_CONFIG` to be `false`.
It now sets it to false automatically unless specifically set in the consumer factory or the container's consumer property overrides.

The `ackOnError` property is now `false` by default.
See <<seek-to-current>> for more information.

It is now possible to obtain the consumer's `group.id` property in the listener method.
See <<listener-group-id>> for more information.

The container has a new property `recordInterceptor` allowing records to be inspected or modified before invoking the listener.
A `CompositeRecordInterceptor` is also provided in case you need to invoke multiple interceptors.
See <<message-listener-container>> for more information.

The `ConsumerSeekAware` has new methods allowing you to perform seeks relative to the beginning, end, or current position and to seek to the first offset greater than or equal to a time stamp.
See <<seek>> for more information.

A convenience class `AbstractConsumerSeekAware` is now provided to simplify seeking.
See <<seek>> for more information.

The `ContainerProperties` provides an `idleBetweenPolls` option to let the main loop in the listener container to sleep between `KafkaConsumer.poll()` calls.
See its JavaDocs and <<kafka-container>> for more information.

When using `AckMode.MANUAL` (or `MANUAL_IMMEDIATE`) you can now cause a redelivery by calling `nack` on the `Acknowledgment`.
See <<committing-offsets>> for more information.

Listener performance can now be monitored using Micrometer `Timer` s.
See <<micrometer>> for more information.

The containers now publish additional consumer lifecycle events relating to startup.
See <<events>> for more information.

Transactional batch listeners can now support zombie fencing.
See <<transactions>> for more information.

The listener container factory can now be configured with a `ContainerCustomizer` to further configure each container after it has been created and configured.
See <<container-factory>> for more information.

==== ErrorHandler Changes

The `SeekToCurrentErrorHandler` now treats certain exceptions as fatal and disables retry for those, invoking the recoverer on first failure.

The `SeekToCurrentErrorHandler` and `SeekToCurrentBatchErrorHandler` can now be configured to apply a `BackOff` (thread sleep) between delivery attempts.

Starting with version 2.3.2, recovered records' offsets will be committed when the error handler returns after recovering a failed record.

See <<seek-to-current>> for more information.

The `DeadLetterPublishingRecoverer`, when used in conjunction with an `ErrorHandlingDeserializer`, now sets the payload of the message sent to the dead-letter topic, to the original value that could not be deserialized.
Previously, it was `null` and user code needed to extract the `DeserializationException` from the message headers.
See <<dead-letters>> for more information.

==== TopicBuilder

A new class `TopicBuilder` is provided for more convenient creation of `NewTopic` `@Bean` s for automatic topic provisioning.
See <<configuring-topics>> for more information.

==== Kafka Streams Changes

You can now perform additional configuration of the `StreamsBuilderFactoryBean` created by `@EnableKafkaStreams`.
See <<streams-config, Streams Configuration>> for more information.

A `RecoveringDeserializationExceptionHandler` is now provided which allows records with deserialization errors to be recovered.
It can be used in conjunction with a `DeadLetterPublishingRecoverer` to send these records to a dead-letter topic.
See <<streams-deser-recovery>> for more information.

The `HeaderEnricher` transformer has been provided, using SpEL to generate the header values.
See <<streams-header-enricher>> for more information.

The `MessagingTransformer` has been provided.
This allows a Kafka streams topology to interact with a spring-messaging component, such as a Spring Integration flow.
See <<streams-messaging>> and See https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/docs/current/reference/html/kafka.html#streams-integration[[Calling a Spring Integration Flow from a `KStream`]] for more information.

==== JSON Component Changes

Now all the JSON-aware components are configured by default with a Jackson `ObjectMapper` produced by the `JacksonUtils.enhancedObjectMapper()`.
The `JsonDeserializer` now provides `TypeReference`-based constructors for better handling of target generic container types.
Also a `JacksonMimeTypeModule` has been introduced for serialization of `org.springframework.util.MimeType` to plain string.
See its JavaDocs and <<serdes>> for more information.

A `ByteArrayJsonMessageConverter` has been provided as well as a new super class for all Json converters, `JsonMessageConverter`.
Also, a `StringOrBytesSerializer` is now available; it can serialize `byte[]`, `Bytes` and `String` values in `ProducerRecord` s.
See <<messaging-message-conversion>> for more information.

The `JsonSerializer`, `JsonDeserializer` and `JsonSerde` now have fluent APIs to make programmatic configuration simpler.
See the javadocs, <<serdes>>, and <<serde>> for more informaion.

==== ReplyingKafkaTemplate

When a reply times out, the future is completed exceptionally with a `KafkaReplyTimeoutException` instead of a `KafkaException`.

Also, an overloaded `sendAndReceive` method is now provided that allows specifying the reply timeout on a per message basis.

==== AggregatingReplyingKafkaTemplate

Extends the `ReplyingKafkaTemplate` by aggregating replies from multiple receivers.
See <<aggregating-request-reply>> for more information.

==== Transaction Changes

You can now override the producer factory's `transactionIdPrefix` on the `KafkaTemplate` and `KafkaTransactionManager`.
See <<transaction-id-prefix>> for more information.

==== New Delegating Serializer/Deserializer

The framework now provides a delegating `Serializer` and `Deserializer`, utilizing a header to enable producing and consuming records with multiple key/value types.
See <<delegating-serialization>> for more information.

==== New Retrying Deserializer

The framework now provides a delegating `RetryingDeserializer`, to retry serialization when transient errors such as network problems might occur.
See <<retrying-deserialization>> for more information.

=== Changes Between 2.1 and 2.2

[[kafka-client-2.0]]
==== Kafka Client Version

This version requires the 2.0.0 `kafka-clients` or higher.

==== Class and Package Changes

The `ContainerProperties` class has been moved from `org.springframework.kafka.listener.config` to `org.springframework.kafka.listener`.

The `AckMode` enum has been moved from `AbstractMessageListenerContainer` to `ContainerProperties`.

The `setBatchErrorHandler()` and `setErrorHandler()` methods have been moved from `ContainerProperties` to both `AbstractMessageListenerContainer` and `AbstractKafkaListenerContainerFactory`.

==== After Rollback Processing

A new `AfterRollbackProcessor` strategy is provided.
See <<after-rollback>> for more information.

==== `ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory` Changes

You can now use the `ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory` to create and configure any `ConcurrentMessageListenerContainer`, not only those for `@KafkaListener` annotations.
See <<container-factory>> for more information.

==== Listener Container Changes

A new container property (`missingTopicsFatal`) has been added.
See <<kafka-container>> for more information.

A `ConsumerStoppedEvent` is now emitted when a consumer stops.
See <<thread-safety>> for more information.

Batch listeners can optionally receive the complete `ConsumerRecords<?, ?>` object instead of a `List<ConsumerRecord<?, ?>`.
See <<batch-listeners>> for more information.

The `DefaultAfterRollbackProcessor` and `SeekToCurrentErrorHandler` can now recover (skip) records that keep failing, and, by default, does so after 10 failures.
They can be configured to publish failed records to a dead-letter topic.

Starting with version 2.2.4, the consumer's group ID can be used while selecting the dead letter topic name.

See <<after-rollback>>, <<seek-to-current>>, and <<dead-letters>> for more information.

The `ConsumerStoppingEvent` has been added.
See <<events>> for more information.

The `SeekToCurrentErrorHandler` can now be configured to commit the offset of a recovered record when the container is configured with `AckMode.MANUAL_IMMEDIATE` (since 2.2.4).
See <<seek-to-current>> for more information.

==== @KafkaListener Changes

You can now override the `concurrency` and `autoStartup` properties of the listener container factory by setting properties on the annotation.
You can now add configuration to determine which headers (if any) are copied to a reply message.
See <<kafka-listener-annotation>> for more information.

You can now use `@KafkaListener` as a meta-annotation on your own annotations.
See <<kafka-listener-meta>> for more information.

It is now easier to configure a `Validator` for `@Payload` validation.
See <<kafka-validation>> for more information.

You can now specify kafka consumer properties directly on the annotation; these will override any properties with the same name defined in the consumer factory (since version 2.2.4).
See <<annotation-properties>> for more information.

==== Header Mapping Changes

Headers of type `MimeType` and `MediaType` are now mapped as simple strings in the `RecordHeader` value.
Previously, they were mapped as JSON and only `MimeType` was decoded.
`MediaType` could not be decoded.
They are now simple strings for interoperability.

Also, the `DefaultKafkaHeaderMapper` has a new `addToStringClasses` method, allowing the specification of types that should be mapped by using `toString()` instead of JSON.
See <<headers>> for more information.

==== Embedded Kafka Changes

The `KafkaEmbedded` class and its `KafkaRule` interface have been deprecated in favor of the `EmbeddedKafkaBroker` and its JUnit 4 `EmbeddedKafkaRule` wrapper.
The `@EmbeddedKafka` annotation now populates an `EmbeddedKafkaBroker` bean instead of the deprecated `KafkaEmbedded`.
This change allows the use of `@EmbeddedKafka` in JUnit 5 tests.
The `@EmbeddedKafka` annotation now has the attribute `ports` to specify the port that populates the `EmbeddedKafkaBroker`.
See <<testing>> for more information.

==== JsonSerializer/Deserializer Enhancements

You can now provide type mapping information by using producer and consumer properties.

New constructors are available on the deserializer to allow overriding the type header information with the supplied target type.

The `JsonDeserializer` now removes any type information headers by default.

You can now configure the `JsonDeserializer` to ignore type information headers by using a Kafka property (since 2.2.3).

See <<serdes>> for more information.

==== Kafka Streams Changes

The streams configuration bean must now be a `KafkaStreamsConfiguration` object instead of a `StreamsConfig` object.

The `StreamsBuilderFactoryBean` has been moved from package `...core` to `...config`.

The `KafkaStreamBrancher` has been introduced for better end-user experience when conditional branches are built on top of `KStream` instance.

See <<streams-kafka-streams>> and <<streams-config>> for more information.


==== Transactional ID

When a transaction is started by the listener container, the `transactional.id` is now the `transactionIdPrefix` appended with `<group.id>.<topic>.<partition>`.
This change allows proper fencing of zombies, https://www.confluent.io/blog/transactions-apache-kafka/[as described here].


=== Changes Between 2.0 and 2.1

[[kafka-client-1.0]]
==== Kafka Client Version

This version requires the 1.0.0 `kafka-clients` or higher.

The 1.1.x client is supported natively in version 2.2.

==== JSON Improvements

The `StringJsonMessageConverter` and `JsonSerializer` now add type information in `Headers`, letting the converter and `JsonDeserializer` create specific types on reception, based on the message itself rather than a fixed configured type.
See <<serdes>> for more information.


==== Container Stopping Error Handlers

Container error handlers are now provided for both record and batch listeners that treat any exceptions thrown by the listener as fatal/
They stop the container.
See <<annotation-error-handling>> for more information.

==== Pausing and Resuming Containers

The listener containers now have `pause()` and `resume()` methods (since version 2.1.3).
See <<pause-resume>> for more information.

==== Stateful Retry

Starting with version 2.1.3, you can configure stateful retry.
See <<stateful-retry>> for more information.

==== Client ID

Starting with version 2.1.1, you can now set the `client.id` prefix on `@KafkaListener`.
Previously, to customize the client ID, you needed a separate consumer factory (and container factory) per listener.
The prefix is suffixed with `-n` to provide unique client IDs when you use concurrency.


==== Logging Offset Commits

By default, logging of topic offset commits is performed with the `DEBUG` logging level.
Starting with version 2.1.2, a new property in `ContainerProperties` called `commitLogLevel` lets you specify the log level for these messages.
See <<kafka-container>> for more information.

==== Default @KafkaHandler

Starting with version 2.1.3, you can designate one of the `@KafkaHandler` annotations on a class-level `@KafkaListener` as the default.
See <<class-level-kafkalistener>> for more information.

==== ReplyingKafkaTemplate

Starting with version 2.1.3, a subclass of `KafkaTemplate` is provided to support request/reply semantics.
See <<replying-template>> for more information.

==== ChainedKafkaTransactionManager

Version 2.1.3 introduced the `ChainedKafkaTransactionManager`.
(It is now deprecated).

==== Migration Guide from 2.0

See the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-kafka/wiki/Spring-for-Apache-Kafka-2.0-to-2.1-Migration-Guide[2.0 to 2.1 Migration] guide.

=== Changes Between 1.3 and 2.0

==== Spring Framework and Java Versions

The Spring for Apache Kafka project now requires Spring Framework 5.0 and Java 8.

==== `@KafkaListener` Changes

You can now annotate `@KafkaListener` methods (and classes and `@KafkaHandler` methods) with `@SendTo`.
If the method returns a result, it is forwarded to the specified topic.
See <<annotation-send-to>> for more information.

==== Message Listeners

Message listeners can now be aware of the `Consumer` object.
See <<message-listeners>> for more information.

==== Using `ConsumerAwareRebalanceListener`

Rebalance listeners can now access the `Consumer` object during rebalance notifications.
See <<rebalance-listeners>> for more information.

=== Changes Between 1.2 and 1.3

==== Support for Transactions

The 0.11.0.0 client library added support for transactions.
The `KafkaTransactionManager` and other support for transactions have been added.
See <<transactions>> for more information.

==== Support for Headers

The 0.11.0.0 client library added support for message headers.
These can now be mapped to and from `spring-messaging` `MessageHeaders`.
See <<headers>> for more information.

==== Creating Topics

The 0.11.0.0 client library provides an `AdminClient`, which you can use to create topics.
The `KafkaAdmin` uses this client to automatically add topics defined as `@Bean` instances.


==== Support for Kafka Timestamps

`KafkaTemplate` now supports an API to add records with timestamps.
New `KafkaHeaders` have been introduced regarding `timestamp` support.
Also, new `KafkaConditions.timestamp()` and `KafkaMatchers.hasTimestamp()` testing utilities have been added.
See <<kafka-template>>, <<kafka-listener-annotation>>, and <<testing>> for more details.

==== `@KafkaListener` Changes

You can now configure a `KafkaListenerErrorHandler` to handle exceptions.
See <<annotation-error-handling>> for more information.

By default, the `@KafkaListener` `id` property is now used as the `group.id` property, overriding the property configured in the consumer factory (if present).
Further, you can explicitly configure the `groupId` on the annotation.
Previously, you would have needed a separate container factory (and consumer factory) to use different `group.id` values for listeners.
To restore the previous behavior of using the factory configured `group.id`, set the `idIsGroup` property on the annotation to `false`.

==== `@EmbeddedKafka` Annotation

For convenience, a test class-level `@EmbeddedKafka` annotation is provided, to register `KafkaEmbedded` as a bean.
See <<testing>> for more information.

==== Kerberos Configuration

Support for configuring Kerberos is now provided.
See <<kerberos>> for more information.


=== Changes Between 1.1 and 1.2

This version uses the 0.10.2.x client.

=== Changes Between 1.0 and 1.1

==== Kafka Client

This version uses the Apache Kafka 0.10.x.x client.

==== Batch Listeners

Listeners can be configured to receive the entire batch of messages returned by the `consumer.poll()` operation, rather than one at a time.

==== Null Payloads

Null payloads are used to "`delete`" keys when you use log compaction.

==== Initial Offset

When explicitly assigning partitions, you can now configure the initial offset relative to the current position for the consumer group, rather than absolute or relative to the current end.

==== Seek

You can now seek the position of each topic or partition.
You can use this to set the initial position during initialization when group management is in use and Kafka assigns the partitions.
You can also seek when an idle container is detected or at any arbitrary point in your application's execution.
See <<seek>> for more information.
