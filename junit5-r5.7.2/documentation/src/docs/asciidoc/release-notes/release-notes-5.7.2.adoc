[[release-notes-5.7.2-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* Method `getRootUrisForPackage()` in class `ClasspathScanner` now returns a valid list of
  class names when the package name is equal to the name of a module on the module path
  and when running on Java 8.
* Direct child descriptors of the engine descriptor now also acquire the global read lock
  when they require other exclusive resources.


[[release-notes-5.7.2-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* Test classes annotated with `@ResourceLock` no longer run in parallel with `@Isolated`
  ones.

==== New Features and Improvements

* Improved `ExclusiveResource` handling: if a `Node` has only read locks and no read-write
  locks, then descendants are not forced into `SAME_THREAD` execution and can run
  concurrently.

=== JUnit Vintage
