[[release-notes-5.8.0-M1-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* `SummaryGeneratingListener` is now thread-safe and can handle concurrently failing tests.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* For consistency with the rest of the JUnit Platform, the experimental
  `LauncherDiscoveryListener` is now an interface instead of an abstract class.

==== New Features and Improvements

* New `test(Condition<Event>)` and `nestedContainer(Class<?>, Condition<Event>)` methods
  in `EventConditions` that allow you to provide conditions for matching against test and
  nested container events when using the `EngineTestKit`. For example,
  `test(displayName("my test"))` can be used to match against a test whose display name is
  `my test`.
* The `junit-platform-jfr` module now reports execution events for containers -- for
  example, test classes.
* The `junit-platform-jfr` module now reports test discovery events for the launcher and
  registered test engines.
* Custom `LauncherDiscoveryListener` implementations can now be registered via Java’s
  `{ServiceLoader}` mechanism.
* Documented constant value of `ExclusiveResource.GLOBAL_KEY`.
* Instances of `TestIdentifier` and `UniqueId` now retain less memory because they no
  longer store `String` representations of unique IDs.
* Tools that make multiple calls to the `Launcher` API should now create a
  `LauncherSession` in order to allow for executing global setup and teardown code exactly
  once via the new `LauncherSessionListener` interface that can be registered via Java’s
  `{ServiceLoader}` mechanism.
* New `junit-platform-suite-engine` to execute declarative test suites using the JUnit
  Platform Launcher.
* Additional selectors in the suite API in the `junit-platform-suite-api` module.


[[release-notes-5.8.0-M1-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* `InvocationInterceptor.interceptDynamicTest(Invocation<Void>, ExtensionContext)` has
  been deprecated in favor of
  `InvocationInterceptor.interceptDynamicTest(Invocation<Void>, DynamicTestInvocationContext, ExtensionContext)`
  that provides access to the dynamic test executable via
  `DynamicTestInvocationContext.getExecutable()`.

==== New Features and Improvements

* Top-level test classes can now be ordered by passing the fully-qualified name of a class
  implementing `ClassOrderer` as the value of the new
  `junit.jupiter.testclass.order.default` configuration parameter.
* New `assertInstanceOf()` methods which produce better error messages comparable to those
  produced by `assertThrows`. These new methods serve as a replacement for
  `assertTrue(obj instanceof X)`.
* `assertNull()` failure messages now include the actual object's type if the `toString()`
  implementation for the actual object returns `null` or `"null"`. This avoids the
  generation of confusing failure messages such as `expected <null> but was <null>`.
* Numeric literals used with `@CsvSource` or `CsvFileSource` can now be expressed using
  underscores as in some JVM languages, to improve readability of long numbers like
  `700_000_000`.
* CSV rows provided via `@CsvSource` may now start with a number sign (`#`).
* New `ignoreLeadingAndTrailingWhitespace` attributes in `@CsvSource` and `@CsvFileSource`
  (set to `true` by default) to control whether or not to trim whitespace.
* Dynamic tests now require less memory thanks to a number of improvements to internal
  data structures.
* Documented constant values in `org.junit.jupiter.api.parallel.Resources`.
* In parameterized tests with `@MethodSource` or `@ArgumentSource`, arguments can now have
  optional names (supplied via the new `Named` API). When the argument is included in the
  display name of an iteration, this name will be used instead of the value.
* `DynamicTests.stream()` can now consume `Named` input and will use each name-value pair
  as the display name and value for each generated dynamic test (see
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-dynamic-tests-examples,User Guide>> for details).


[[release-notes-5.8.0-M1-junit-vintage]]
=== JUnit Vintage

==== New Features and Improvements

* The JUnit Vintage engine now requires less memory and allows for earlier garbage
  collection thanks to a number of improvements to internal data structures.
