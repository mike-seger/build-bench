=== JUnit Platform Suite Engine

The JUnit Platform supports declarative definition and execution of suites of tests from
_any_ test engine using the Junit Platform.

==== Setup

In addition to _at least one_ other test engine, you need the following artifacts and
their dependencies on the classpath. See <<dependency-metadata>> for details regarding
group IDs, artifact IDs, and versions.

===== Explicit Dependencies

* `junit-platform-suite-api` in _test_ scope
* `junit-platform-suite-engine` in _test runtime_ scope: implementation of the
                                `TestEngine` API for the declarative Junit Platform
                                Suites

NOTE: Both dependencies are aggregated in `junit-platform-suite` which can be used in
_test_ scope.

===== Transitive Dependencies

* `junit-platform-suite-commons` in _test_ scope
* `junit-platform-launcher` in _test_ scope
* `junit-platform-engine` in _test_ scope
* `junit-platform-commons` in _test_ scope
* `opentest4j` in _test_ scope

==== Test Suite

By annotating a class with `@Suite` it is marked as a test suite on the JUnit Platform.
As seen in the following example, selector and filter annotations can then be used to
control the contents of the suite.

.Additional Configuration Options
NOTE: There are more configuration options for discovering and filtering tests than just
`@SelectPackages`. Please consult the Javadoc of the `{suite-api-package}` package for
further details.
